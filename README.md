# ML Algorithms from Scratch  

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms developed from scratch using core Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. No high-level ML libraries like `scikit-learn` are used to provide a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work internally.  

## Objective  
The goal of this repository is to:  
- Gain insights into the mathematical foundation of ML algorithms.  
- Understand how different algorithms process data.  
- Develop proficiency in implementing ML concepts without relying on pre-built libraries.  

## Features  
- Pure Python implementation of ML algorithms.  
- Clear, modular code structure for easy understanding and reuse.  
- Example datasets and visualization for algorithm demonstration.  

## Algorithms Implemented  
### Supervised Learning  
- **Regression**:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Polynomial Regression  
- **Classification**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Decision Trees  

### Unsupervised Learning  
- K-Means Clustering  

### Optimization Techniques  
- Gradient Descent (used in multiple algorithms)
